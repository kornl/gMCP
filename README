			gMCP GITHUB README

The development version of this package can be directly installed with the R package devtools from Hadley Wickham et al. using:

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("gMCP", username="kornl", subdir="pkg/gMCP")

But note that the gMCP jar file is only rarely updated and it may be appropriate to build it yourself from newer Java source code.

Otherwise just use the current version from CRAN:
