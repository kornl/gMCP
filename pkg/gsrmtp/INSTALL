The installation of gsrmtp via install.packages("gsrmtp") should be unproblematic.

However some of the packages gsrmtp depends on or suggests can be tricky to install on non-windows machines.

rJava:
======

Follow the instructions of rJava.
Most likely you will have to run the command "R CMD javareconf" with root permissions to let R find your java compiler and headers.

Rgraphviz:
==========

For visualization the method renderGraph from package Rgraphviz can be used, which uses the graphviz library.
Therefore you need to install the libraries and headers necessary to link graphviz library routines into the Rgraphviz package.
For example on Debian/Ubuntu you need to install the package libgraphviz-dev beforehand:

sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev

To install Rgraphviz, start R and enter:

source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Rgraphviz")
