- package mutoss is not available on CRAN
- In af.statguitoolkit.graph.UpdateEdge:
setW -> ((AbstractGraphControl)(AbstractControl.getInstance())).getNL().addEdge(edge.von, edge.nach, w);
setW with w=0 is bad, since it does not delete the edge.
- highlight is cool - but how can I tell r-forge or CRAN to use it?

- CITATION file?

- graph2latex turns graphs upside / down.
- Why is the space in for example "F.ËœBretz," still shown in the pdf?
- We have the same Generics as Rgraphviz:
library(Rgraphviz)
getX(new("xyPoint", x=150, y=30))
This causes trouble.
