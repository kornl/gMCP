\section{Introduction}

This package provides functions and graphical user interfaces for sequentially rejective multiple test procedures.

At all steps either graphical user interfaces or the R Console, S4 objects and methods can be used.   

\section{Creating the graph}

In the first step a graph that describes the multiple test procedures
must be created.

alpha <- c(0.05/3, 0.05/3, 0.05/3, 0, 0, 0)
edges <- list()
edges[["H11"]] <- list(edges=c("H21","H12"), weights=c(1/2, 1/2))
edges[["H21"]] <- list(edges=c("H11","H31","H22"), weights=c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3))
edges[["H31"]] <- list(edges=c("H21","H32"), weights=c(1/2, 1/2))
edges[["H12"]] <- list(edges="H21", weights=1)
edges[["H22"]] <- list(edges=c("H11","H31"), weights=c(1/2, 1/2))
edges[["H32"]] <- list(edges="H21", weights=1)

\subsection{Using R}

We build upon the package \texttt{graph} \cite{graph}, more precisely
we declare a new class \texttt{graphSRMTP} that is a subclass of
\texttt{graphNEL}.  The \texttt{initialize} method of this subclass
differs only in an extra argument \texttt{alpha}, the initial
allocation of the significance level alpha to the individual
hypotheses.  Declaration of the nodes and edges is inherited from
class \texttt{graphNEL}.

As an example we now create the graph from \cite{bretzEtAl2009power}
that you can see in figure \ref{exampleGraphBretz}.

\scriptsize
<<echo=TRUE>>=

hnodes <- c("H11", "H21", "H31", "H12", "H22", "H32")
alpha <- c(0.05/3, 0.05/3, 0.05/3, 0, 0, 0)
edges <- list()
edges[["H11"]] <- list(edges=c("H21","H12"), weights=c(1/2, 1/2))
edges[["H21"]] <- list(edges=c("H11","H31","H22"), weights=c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3))
edges[["H31"]] <- list(edges=c("H21","H32"), weights=c(1/2, 1/2))
edges[["H12"]] <- list(edges="H21", weights=1)
edges[["H22"]] <- list(edges=c("H11","H31"), weights=c(1/2, 1/2))
edges[["H32"]] <- list(edges="H21", weights=1)
graph <- new("graphSRMTP", nodes=hnodes, edgeL=edges, alpha=alpha)

@
\normalsize

Let's print the newly created graph:

\scriptsize
<<echo=TRUE>>=

print(graph)

@
\normalsize

Since we also want to visualize the graph, we use the method
\texttt{nodeRenderInfo} from package \texttt{graph} to set appropriate
x- and y-coordinates in the renderInfo.

\scriptsize
<<echo=TRUE>>=

nodeX <- c(H11=10, H21=20, H31=30, H12=10, H22=20, H32=30)
nodeY <- c(H11=20, H21=20, H31=20, H12=10, H22=10, H32=10)
nodeRenderInfo(graph) <- list(nodeX=nodeX, nodeY=nodeY)	

@
\normalsize

Let's take a look at the graph in {\LaTeX} rendered with TikZ
\cite{TikZ} (you can see the compiled result in figure
\ref{exampleGraphBretz}):

\scriptsize
%\lstset{language=[LaTeX]TeX}
%\begin{lstlisting}
<<echo=TRUE>>=

cat(graph2latex(graph))

@
%\end{lstlisting}
\normalsize

\subsection{Using the GUI}

The following command starts a graphical user interface for the
creation of SRMTP graphs.  Its only argument is the variable name for
the graph, given as a character string, under which the created
\texttt{graphSRMTP} object will be available from the R command line.

\scriptsize
<<echo=TRUE>>=

graphGUI("graph")

@
\normalsize

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering    
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{GraphCreation.png}      
  \caption{The graphical user interface of the package gsrmtp.}
\end{figure}

The GUI also allows you to update existing graphs.

\section{The sequentially rejective MTP}

For a full description of the sequentially rejective multiple testing
procedure take a look at \cite{bretzEtAl2009graphical}. 

\subsection{Using R}

You can either specify each rejection step yourself or simply use the 
method \texttt{srmtp}:

\scriptsize
<<echo=TRUE>>=

graph <- createGraphFromBretzEtAl()
pvalues <- c(0.1, 0.008, 0.005, 0.15, 0.04, 0.006)
result <- srmtp(graph, pvalues)
print(result)

@
\normalsize

We can take a look at the last graph (see figure \ref{finalstate}):

\scriptsize
<<echo=TRUE>>=

cat(graph2latex(result@graphs[[4]]))

@
\normalsize

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering   
<<echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=

cat(graph2latex(result@graphs[[4]]))

@
  \caption{\label{finalstate}Final graph from the test procedure after rejection of $H_{21}$, $H_{31}$ and $H_{32}$.}
\end{figure}

The command \texttt{createGsrmtpReport} can generate a full report:

\scriptsize
<<echo=TRUE>>=

createGsrmtpReport(result, "Report.tex")

@
\normalsize

\subsection{Using the GUI}

\section{Important TikZ commands for optimizing the reports}
A clear automatic placement of edges and weight labels without overlapping is a very difficult task 
and for complicated graphs the \texttt{gsrmtp} package will often fail to accomplish this.
There is the possibilty to adjust the edges and labels in the GUI, but since the {\LaTeX} graph layout is not (yet) exactly the same,
there is perhaps the need for adjusting the graphs in the TikZ code.
The TikZ program is very useful and we recommend it for many purposes,
but perhaps you don't have the time to read the 560 pages manual \cite{TikZ},
so here is a short overview of the most important commands for this kind of graphs.

Let's start with this graph in figure \ref{uglygraph}:

\scriptsize
\lstset{language=[LaTeX]TeX}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
\node (H11) at (200bp,200bp) [draw,circle split,fill=green!80] {$H11$ \nodepart{lower} $0.0333$};
...
\draw [->,line width=1pt] (H11) to[bend left=15] node[near start,above,fill=blue!20] {0.667} (H12);
...
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{lstlisting}
\normalsize

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering   
<<echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=

cat(graph2latex(result@graphs[[3]], pvalues=pvalues))

@
  \caption{\label{uglygraph}Graph from \texttt{graph2latex} that does not look optimal.}
\end{figure}

You can scale the TikZ graphic by changing the \texttt{[scale=0.7]}
option.  By default \texttt{graph2latex} scales down all TikZ graphic
to 70\% and has an optional parameter \texttt{scale}.

For an explanation what \texttt{green!80} means and how you can
specify other colors, please take a look at the xcolor manual
\cite{xcolor}.

You can choose between the following label positions \texttt{above,
  below, right, left, above right, above left, below right}, and
\texttt{below left}.  In addition these positions can take an optional
dimension argument, so that for example \texttt{below=1pt} can be used
to place a label below and additionally shift it 1pt downwards.

You can change the position where the edge weight label is placed to
\texttt{at start, very near start, near start, midway, near end, very
  near end} and \texttt{at end} or simply use something like
\texttt{pos=0.5}.  If you add an argument \texttt{sloped}, the text
label will be rotated so that a parallel line to the base line becomes
a tangent to the edge.

Often it is useful to reduce the bending angle in \texttt{[bend
    left=15]} below 15. You could also specify and change
\texttt{out=15} and \texttt{in=165} separately.

A powerful feature is the use of styles, since this will effect all
objects of a given class. But for this please take a look directly at
the TikZ manual \cite{TikZ}.
