High priority:

- We have the same Generics as Rgraphviz:
library(Rgraphviz)
getX(new("xyPoint", x=150, y=30))
This causes trouble
- matrix2graph function
- Check on Windows whether "\" work in ActionExportToLatex or have to be modified.
- Look at print method for gMCPResult
- Can we add a RUnit Test for Java imports Random Graph and then exports the same graph?
- Warn user when sum of edge weights is bigger than 1
- Which error does the user get, if the sum of alpha is bigger than 1 in the GUI and the console?
- What happens if I try to create nodes with the same name? Is Node.nr used for something?
(Saving to R returns an error: Ungültiges Objekt der Klasse "graphMCP": FALSE)
- Update graph2latex to the much better algorithm already implemented in Java.
- PPanels will set alpha to the truncated number.
- It is possible to create loops that will cause problems.
- Alpha is not passed along epsilon edges.
- Start button should not be enabled, if no node exists.

Additional features / low priority:

- Add MenuBar
- Cleanup Config
- Why is the tilde in for example "F.˜Bretz" still shown in the pdf?
- Check to which RJava version we are compatible.
- Package highlight is cool - but how can I tell r-forge or CRAN to use it?

- Edge labels should be fixed and placed by user or free and adjust to moving nodes
- CITATION file? 

@graph-package:

How do I create a graphNEL object, where there is a node that has no out-going edges?
I thought the following will do it:

hnodes <- c("H1","H2")
edges <- vector("list", length=2)
edges[[1]] <- list(edges=c("H2"), weights=c(1.0))
edges[[2]] <- list(edges=character(0), weights=numeric(0))
# or "edges[[2]] <- list()" which gives the same result.
names(edges)<-hnodes
g <- new("graphNEL", nodes=hnodes, edgeL=edges, "directed")

But the problem is, that g@edgeData@data[[1]]$weight is now a numeric with attribute "names".
This makes problems, for example it confuses edgeWeights: 

edgeWeights(g)
$H1
H2.H1
        1 

$H2
numeric(0)

In my understanding this should be "H2" instead of "H2.H1" like it would be when H2 has any outgoing edges.
