High priority:
==============

- FileChooser should not look at locale - set locale to english
- explain users what transparence in images is 
- press e for epsilon, or 1+e+e^2
- objectname to save / load (load and save button)
- show values in percent
- display fractions as fractions and allow input as for example 1/7
- alpha = 1 causes problems, when interpreted as weights 
- TODO is not recognized under Windows as txt file
- Implement support for something like 2*\epsilon or \epsilon^2
 (without using a small value for epsilon like 10^{-6} 
  - that does work already if we ignore rounding problems).
- confidence intervals are strange...
- Option for rounding how many digits we want to see.
- PPanels will set alpha to the truncated number. (Can we handle fractions?)
- What happens if I try to create nodes with the same name? Is Node.nr used for something?
  (Saving to R returns an error: Ungültiges Objekt der Klasse "graphMCP": FALSE)
- Edge weight from node i to node j: m[i,j] or m[j,i] - please decide.
- Even addDefaultNode can add nodes with already existing names.
- Remember the directory where something is saved
- Linewidth in LaTeX and NetList / PNG export
- Flag 1+epsilon as line sum
- round adjusted p-Values up
- standard examples
- parametric menu for bonferroni holm
- do not show rejected null hypothesis
- default to 1 for edges
- 

Medium priority:
================

- We have the same Generics as Rgraphviz:
  library(Rgraphviz)
  getX(new("xyPoint", x=150, y=30))
  This causes trouble
- Warn user when sum of edge weights is bigger than 1
- Check mutator methods for errors (alpha > 1, edge weights > 1)
- Update graph2latex to the much better algorithm already implemented in Java.
- Don't create global variable like .tmpGraph etc.
- gMCPReport does not work for graphs without layout.
- graphGUI should have a parameter pvalues.


Additional features / low priority:
===================================

- Look at print method for gMCPResult
- Cleanup Config
- PNG export cuts perhaps edges.
- Speed-up -> Matrices & perhaps ?ReferenceClasses ?
- Why is the tilde in for example "F.˜Bretz" still shown in the pdf?
- Package highlight is cool - but how can I tell r-forge or CRAN to use it?
See also http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.general/200179
- Edge labels should be fixed and placed by user or free and adjust to moving nodes
- CITATION file? 
- Can we add a RUnit Test for Java imports Random Graph and then exports the same graph?
- Icon for saving graphs? (And do we need this button?)
- TikZ styles for rejected / rejectable nodes
- browseURL("http://gsrmtp.r-forge.r-project.org/")
- LogPanel looks ugly -> bug in afcommons
- Check for loops in matrix2graph
- further tests

@Apple - is this a problem?

@graph-package:

How do I create a graphNEL object, where there is a node that has no out-going edges?
I thought the following will do it:

hnodes <- c("H1","H2")
edges <- vector("list", length=2)
edges[[1]] <- list(edges=c("H2"), weights=c(1.0))
edges[[2]] <- list(edges=character(0), weights=numeric(0))
# or "edges[[2]] <- list()" which gives the same result.
names(edges)<-hnodes
g <- new("graphNEL", nodes=hnodes, edgeL=edges, "directed")

But the problem is, that g@edgeData@data[[1]]$weight is now a numeric with attribute "names".
This makes problems, for example it confuses edgeWeights: 

edgeWeights(g)
$H1
H2.H1
        1 

$H2
numeric(0)

In my understanding this should be "H2" instead of "H2.H1" like it would be when H2 has any outgoing edges.

As always:
==========
- more references, since some people will actually look at this package.
- More details in manual pages.
