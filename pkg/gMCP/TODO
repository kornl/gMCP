Critical:
=========

- Think about JavaGD devices. (User wants to plot in R Console etc.)
- Does Deducer interfere JavaGD? (When is .onLoad executed?)
- Make JavaGD only a suggest (Solaris and generally safer)
- g <- HuqueAloshEtBhore2011()

- Check installed structure of Windows binary.

High priority:
==============

- Graphs with variables should be set back to the version with variables.
- An empty string for an edge weight creates a bug report window.
- Show optional dialog when refresh button is pressed.
- Check java.awt.Desktop.open in the newest Ubuntu (or is there something else wrong?)
- graphTest's last.alphas at least contain strange NaN in some cases
g <- parallelGatekeeping()
graphTest(pvalues=c(0, 1, 0, 0), alpha=0.05, graph=graph)

attr(,"last.alphas")
[1] NaN NaN   0   0

- Give link to gMCP mailing list
- HighRes option for PNG export

- Update description / references in "Example Graphs"
- graphTest renames hypotheses to H1...Hn or drops them completely in the output
- Björns Mail
- "Note that with the exceptions of INDEX, LICENSE/LICENCE and NEWS, information files at the top level
  of the package will not be installed and so not be known to users of Windows and Mac OS X 
  compiled packages (and not seen by those who use R CMD INSTALL or install.packages on the tarball). 
  So any information files you wish an end user to see should be included in inst. 
  Note that if the named exceptions also occur in inst, the versions in inst will be that seen in 
  the installed package."
- "The preferred location for vignette sources is now the directory
  vignettes and not inst/doc: R CMD build will now re-build
  vignettes in directory vignettes and copy the .Rnw (etc) files
  and the corresponding PDFs to inst/doc.  Further files to be
  copied to inst/doc can be specified _via_ the file
  vignettes/.install_extras."
- "The package environment is sealed, so you cannot use it to store
  changing values.  Use a separate environment instead: there are
  examples in package 'grDevices' for example."
- "The preferred location for vignette sources is now directory
  'vignettes' and not 'inst/doc'.  If you want to maintain compatibility
  with R <= 2.13.x for the time being, do at least make use of a
  .Rinstignore file to avoid installing anything other than the vignette
  .Rnw (etc) and .pdf files, plus any other files needed for end-users
  to run the vignette code.
  If you know a priori that the vignettes cannot be re-made on CRAN
  (e.g. because you use unusual LaTeX files), set the BuildVignettes
  field in the DESCRIPTION file to a false value.  (The R code in the
  vignettes as extracted by Stangle still needs to be runnable.)"
- Check for missing suggested packages (JavaGD, graph) 
  and ask on startup whether they should be installed and name the features that are otherwise missing.
- Give feedback for old objects and missing graph package in GUI
- Remove warnings: es gibt kein Paket names 'graph'
- Some edge labels like for parallel gatekeeping are set to small values (0?)
- On Windows: Autoresize of the adjacency matrix does often not work.
- "Reject and pass \alpha" does not make sense in the parametric case (actually it does, if we 
- Option "Show fractions" has no influence on TextFields for weights etc
- What happens if we start the GUI a second time?
- Why does matrix(c(0,1/2,0,0),2) loose half an alpha?
- Example graphs from Ferber?
- In CI-Dialog (initial weights instead of alpha are displayed - this are two errors)
- Mark cell content (if one clicks and type, one often wants to overwrite)
- Display edges > 1 and < 0. (Also: -1E0)
- Flag 1+epsilon>1 in line sum
- round adjusted p-Values up
- Think about "-Xrs" - see paragraph below.
- somehow p-value labels where disabled (but we were not in testing modus).
- Labels like 1/3+1/2*e also in decimal format: 0.3333+0.5*e
- Variable node weights
- When not using JLaTeXMath graphs with variables are not shown and saved(?) correctly
- useC produces "Final graph after 1 steps:" - simple count the number of rejected hypotheses
- think about naming of rows, cols, weights … but I guess it'll be the advise to use just the mutator methods or if you want to avoid this overhead a warning that you should know what you are doing…
- does something in Björns C code trigger the following false-positive:
Possible MalWare 'W32/NewMalware-Generic-8d27-f554' found in '5832765_287X_AZ-D_PA3__gMCP.dll'. Heuristics score: 336 
- More fairness regarding the Maurer et al. example ("improved" - what does the paper cover)
- All Dialogs should have cancel / ok buttons
- Capture verbose output

Medium priority:
================
- graphAnalysis throws: negative values not allowed in adjacency matrix for e.g. improved parallel gatekeeping.

Lade nötiges Paket: graph
Warnmeldung:

Additional features / low priority:
===================================
- \gamma or \delta are pretty small on edges.
- Save ConfIntPlot as png/bmp or copy to system clip board
- Do we really need PolynomF as dependencies?
- Don't create global variable like .tmpGraph etc.
- Report generation in GUI (and respect the option whether to show rejected null hypothesis)
- TikZ styles for rejected / rejectable nodes
- further tests
- Look at http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
- After interruption of a calculation a new calculation gave:
  "unprotect(): only 0 protected items"
  Should be fixed now - but if we have time to spare, we could look further into this.
- Use of InfoNode Docking Windows? http://www.infonode.net/index.html?idw
  Would increase size by 717 kByte (and bind us to GPL=2)
- Whishlist dialog.
- suppressPackageStartupMessages

     ‘.First.lib’ is called when a package without a name space is
     attached by ‘library’.  (For packages with name spaces see
     ‘.onLoad’.)  It is called with two arguments, the name of the
     library directory where the package was found (i.e., the
     corresponding element of ‘lib.loc’), and the name of the package.
     It is a good place to put calls to ‘library.dynam’ which are
     needed when loading a package into this function (don't call
     ‘library.dynam’ directly, as this will not work if the package is
     not installed in a standard location).  ‘.First.lib’ is invoked
     after the search path interrogated by ‘search()’ has been updated,
     so ‘as.environment(match("package:name", search()))’ will return
     the environment in which the package is stored.  If calling
     ‘.First.lib’ gives an error the loading of the package is
     abandoned, and the package will be unavailable.  Similarly, if the
     option ‘".First.lib"’ has a list element with the package's name,
     this element is called in the same manner as ‘.First.lib’ when the
     package is attached.  This mechanism allows the user to set
     package ‘load hooks’ in addition to startup code as provided by
     the package maintainers, but ‘setHook’ is preferred.

@Apple - is this a problem?

r-patched-macosx-ix86:
checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
2010-10-02 03:00:01.838 R[97724:613] Apple AWT Java VM was loaded on first thread -- can't start AWT. 

-> reference to JGR or Deducer.

rJava: We had the following problem:

> library(rJava)
> .jinit()
> replicate(1000000,rnorm(1))
^C
Java requested System.exit(130), closing R.

We solved it by calling .jinit(parameters="-Xrs")

Does this have side effects?

From http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html :

-Xrs
    Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java virtual machine (JVM). This option is available beginning with J2SE 1.3.1.
    In J2SE 1.3.0, the Shutdown Hooks facility was added to allow orderly shutdown of a Java application. The intent was to allow user cleanup code (such as closing database connections) to run at shutdown, even if the JVM terminates abruptly.
    Sun's JVM catches signals to implement shutdown hooks for abnormal JVM termination. The JVM uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM to initiate the running of shutdown hooks.
    The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the pre-1.2 feature of dumping thread stacks for debugging purposes. Sun's JVM uses SIGQUIT to perform thread dumps.
    Applications embedding the JVM frequently need to trap signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM, which can lead to interference with the JVM's own signal handlers. To address this issue, the -Xrs command-line option has been added beginning in J2SE 1.3.1. When -Xrs is used on Sun's JVM, the signal masks for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are not changed by the JVM, and signal handlers for these signals are not installed.
    There are two consequences of specifying -Xrs:
        * SIGQUIT thread dumps are not available.
        * User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to run, for example by calling System.exit() when the JVM is to be terminated.

- more references, since some people will actually look at this package.
- More details in manual pages.
