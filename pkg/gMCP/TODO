- 1 Page PDF how to use gMCP, including hint for R installation
- press e for epsilon, or 1+e+e^2
- people want to allow alpha = 1 and interpret it as weight, which causes problems
- display fractions as fractions and allow input as for example 1/7
 # eval(parse(text="1/7"))
- Implement support for something like 2*\epsilon or \epsilon^2
 (without using a small value for epsilon like 10^{-6} 
  - that does work already if we ignore rounding problems).
- confidence intervals are strange...
- Option for rounding how many digits we want to see.
(search for DecimalFormat and replace it with getDecFormat())
- PPanels will set alpha to the truncated number.
- Edge weight from node i to node j: m[i,j] or m[j,i] - please decide.
- Flag 1+epsilon as line sum
- round adjusted p-Values up
- standard examples

Medium priority:
================

- We have the same Generics as Rgraphviz:
  library(Rgraphviz)
  getX(new("xyPoint", x=150, y=30))
  This causes trouble
- Warn user when sum of edge weights is bigger than 1
- Check mutator methods for errors (alpha > 1, edge weights > 1)
- Update graph2latex to the much better algorithm already implemented in Java.
- gMCPReport does not work for graphs without layout.
- call calculateWeightString() when options change
- Guide for usage under Mac OS
- Is Node.nr used for something?

Additional features / low priority:
===================================

- Do we really need PolynomF and gtools as dependencies?
- Don't create global variable like .tmpGraph etc.
- Report generation in GUI (and respect the option whether to show rejected null hypothesis)
- Look at print method for gMCPResult
- PNG export cuts perhaps edges. (But already improved!)
- Speed-up -> Matrices & perhaps ?ReferenceClasses ?
- Package highlight is cool - but how can I tell r-forge or CRAN to use it?
See also http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.general/200179
- Edge labels should be fixed and placed by user or free and adjust to moving nodes
- CITATION file? 
- Can we add a RUnit Test for Java importing Random Graphs and then exporting the same graph?
- Icon for saving graphs? (And do we need this button?)
- option to load another R graph
- TikZ styles for rejected / rejectable nodes
- LogPanel looks ugly -> bug in afcommons
- further tests

@Apple - is this a problem?

@graph-package:

How do I create a graphNEL object, where there is a node that has no out-going edges?
I thought the following will do it:

hnodes <- c("H1","H2")
edges <- vector("list", length=2)
edges[[1]] <- list(edges=c("H2"), weights=c(1.0))
edges[[2]] <- list(edges=character(0), weights=numeric(0))
# or "edges[[2]] <- list()" which gives the same result.
names(edges)<-hnodes
g <- new("graphNEL", nodes=hnodes, edgeL=edges, "directed")

But the problem is, that g@edgeData@data[[1]]$weight is now a numeric with attribute "names".
This makes problems, for example it confuses edgeWeights: 

edgeWeights(g)
$H1
H2.H1
        1 

$H2
numeric(0)

In my understanding this should be "H2" instead of "H2.H1" like it would be when H2 has any outgoing edges.

As always:
==========
- more references, since some people will actually look at this package.
- More details in manual pages.
