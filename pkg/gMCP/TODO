High priority:

- We have the same Generics as Rgraphviz:
library(Rgraphviz)
getX(new("xyPoint", x=150, y=30))
This causes trouble
- matrix2graph function
- Check on Windows whether "\" work in ActionExportToLatex or have to be modified.
- Look at print method for gMCPResult
- Can we add a RUnit Test for Java imports Random Graph and then exports the same graph?
- Warn user when sum of edge weights is bigger than 1
- Which error does the user get, if the sum of alpha is bigger than 1 in the GUI and the console?
- What happens if I try to create nodes with the same name? Is Node.nr used for something?
(Saving to R returns an error: Ungültiges Objekt der Klasse "graphMCP": FALSE)
- Default edges should be epsilon edges
- Update graph2latex to the much better algorithm already implemented in Java.

Additional features / low priority:

- Cleanup Config
- Why is the tilde in for example "F.˜Bretz" still shown in the pdf?
- Check to which RJava version we are compatible.
- Package highlight is cool - but how can I tell r-forge or CRAN to use it?

- Edge labels should be fixed and placed by user or free and adjust to moving nodes
- CITATION file?
