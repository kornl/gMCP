Version 0.7-4 (??-01-2012, Rev. 1???)
=====================================

- Many layout improvements.

- Edges have further attributes like color or line type.

- For people who create graphs in R and set the layout in the GUI: 
  If a node is dragged, edge weights also move except when they are "fixed".
  A node is set fixed, if it is dragged itself. 
  Saving and reloading a graph fixes all edges.
  
- More correlation matrices for standard designs + added unbalanced designs.

- If the GUI is closed and the last graph was not yet saved,
  the user is asked whether he wants to save it.

- LookNFeel is now saved between sessions.

- Variable node weights

- Improved focus keeping and reliability of description text field.

- Error reports can be saved as zip files.

- Option for graph creation: If the "add node" button is selected each further click 
  adds nodes until another button is clicked. Similar option for edges. 

- Fixed: The bundled version closes the R console if the GUI is closed.

- Fixed: GUI was more prone to rounding errors
  
- Fixed bug in report generation.

- Experimental: Support for entangled graphs in the GUI

- Experimental: Support for adaptive studies in the GUI
    
- Experimental: Toolkit for annotating graphs (+TikZ export support of annotations)


Version 0.7-3 (16-01-2012, Rev. 1057)
=====================================

- Function "subGraph" renamed to "subgraph" to avoid conflicts with
  package graph.

- Function "replaceVariables" exported and documented.

- Corrected labels in confidence interval dialog (weights instead alpha). 

- User submitted graphs are supported.

- Improved debug information.

- Dialog for loading of R objects gets "Cancel" button.

- GPL notice is shown when the GUI is used for the first time

- The bundled version closes the R console if the GUI is closed.

- Fixed: Since 0.7-2 too much output is printed to the R console.

- Fixed: Checking for updates happend on the event dispatch thread and
  in rare cases the GUI did not respond any more as long as the method 
  was trying to connect to the server.

- Fixed: Some objects with epsilon edges from gMCP < 0.7 could not
  be updated with function updateGraphToNewClassDefinition.
  
- Fixed: Since 0.7-1 graphGUI threw an error if the parameter graph is
  a character vector and an graph object with an equal name
  already existed.
  
- In addition to the RUnit tests gMCP is now also tested by JUnit tests.

Version 0.7-2 (11-12-2011, Rev. 1016)
=====================================

- Fixed: In 0.7-1 the options dialog throws an error.

- Fixed: In the verbose output of 0.7-1 some weights were shown 
  as p_i instead w_i.

- The dialogs for updating/deleting edges and nodes are now modal dialogs.

- The adjacency matrix is not editable while testing is in progress.

- Improved debug information

- Improved drag'n'drop. 
  Also edge labels do not jump any more when double clicked.

Version 0.7-1 (22-11-2011, Rev. 1001)

Version 0.7-0 (26-Aug-2011, Rev. 964)
=====================================

- Package "graph" is no longer a dependency.
  Class definition of graphMCP has changed and is no
  longer a subclass of graphNEL. The function
  gMCP:::updateGraphToNewClassDefinition(object)
  is provided to update old serialized (saved) objects.
  The GUI will use this function on its own if necessary.

- Also not longer a dependency: gtools, xtable, MCPAN

- New dependency: lattice graphics for power simulations

- Due to S4-methods and the optional "graph" package a lot
  of renaming has taken place:
  addEdge -> setEdge, edgeData -> edgeAttr, 
  nodeData -> nodeAttr, nodes -> getNodes 

- Power simulation code from our third author
  Bjoern Bornkamp.

- New example graphs:

  - general and simple Successive Graphs
  - fixedSequence
  - Fallback Procedure
  - Truncated Holm (special case)
  - BauerEtAl2001
  - HuqueAloshEtBhore2011
  - BretzEtAl2009a/b/c

- Renaming of older example graphs to simpler names.

- CI dialog is modal.

- LaTeX-Code can be shown in Dialog and does not have 
  to be saved in a file.

- PValues can be attached to graphMCP objects as an 
  attribute "pvalues".
  
- Function graphGUI has a new parameter:
  experimentalFeatures=FALSE
  Set this to TRUE for experimental features like the following: 

- Power analysis in GUI.

- Code for adaptive procedures (marked as experimental).

Version 0.6-6 (04-Jul-2011, Rev. 860)
=====================================

- Fixed a bug in the GUI that deleted often p-values.

- Adjusted p-values are calculated also in the parametric case.

- Graphs without epsilon edges can be processed by a
  much faster procedure written in C.
  
- matrix2graph & graph2matrix deal better with variable edges.

- Hopefully setDividerLocation works now always correct, i.e. 
  the graph panel will always use 2/3 of the screen.
  
- Fractions like (1-a)/(1+b) are now shown with the 
  correct layout in the GUI.

- Speed up due to reduced Java/R communication.
  (More results are now cached in a Hashtable.)

=====================================

- New dependency: JavaGD, MCPAN

- Example graphs have been renamed (Please look at ?exampleGraph).

- Greek small letters are allowed as variables

    (see graph2FromBretzEtAl2009 as an example).
  - epsilon has to be entered as "\epsilon" instead of "e"

- Below the graphPanel is now a new panel with 
  graph description and graph analysis. 

- Function placeNodes is now exported with new parameters:
  nrow, ncol and force
  
- We use package highlight for the manuals.

- New example graphs:
   
  - Graphs from Hung and Wang (2010) and 
    Bretz et al. (2011)

Version 0.6-1 (09-Apr-2011, Rev. 589)
=====================================

- We use the library JLaTeXMath for edge labeling.

- Eye candy (for example the edge labels have now a border and 
  are always drawn at the end).
  
- The settings for correlation are moved to the p-value panel.

- The value for epsilon is optionally either asked every time
  or the value from the option panel is used.

- Changed the order of the buttons in the main button panel.

- GUI is remembering the last 4 used R objects / files. 

- Since r-forge has rJava problems at the moment and does
  not provide gMCP builds, we pushed 0.6-1 early to CRAN.

Version 0.6-0 (06-Apr-2011, Rev. 547)
=====================================

- The GUI supports edges with variables (although sum checking of
  outgoing edges is disabled then till values are assigned to the
  variables.)
  
- gMCP has new arguments: approxEps=TRUE, eps=10^(-4)
  
- New function: substituteEps

  "offset".
  
 40 files changed, 599 insertions(+), 339 deletions(-)


Version 0.5-0 (28-Mar-2011, Rev. 525)
=====================================

- We use weights instead of direct alpha allocation in the graphs.
  This causes major API changes:

  - gMCP and many other functions have an argument alpha with an
    default 0.05

  - getAlpha is now called getWeights since it returns the weights

  - graph2weights is removed since it is a special case of getWeights

- due to these changes above, graphs that have been saved to files
  will cause errors when loaded and processed

- getX/Y were renamed into getX/YCoordinates due to Rgraphviz
  conflicts.

- graph2latex has a new argument "nodeTikZ".

- new function bdiagNA for building block diagonal matrices with NA
  values outside the diagonal

- Backward compatibility for R 2.8.0 and rJava 0.6-3.

- CTRL+C interrupts only the last R command and does not close the
  whole R session.

- CRAN has disabled checks on arch="ppc", so MacOS builds are again
  available from CRAN.

- Bug report sends now also the result from traceback()

- A lot of bug fixes for corner and edge cases

- CITATION file

- Please note that full epsilon support is postponed for version 0.6-0

  correlation structure from Florian Klinglmueller, who is now
  coauthor.

- New dependencies in this code: gtools and multcomp (and therefore
  also mvtnorm)

- gMCP has a new optional parameter "correlation".

- The new vignette "correlated.pdf" shows the new features.

- graphGUI Parameter grid is now 0 by default. This restores the last
  used grid value.

- Fractions instead of decimal numbers are shown in more places.

- Alpha values can be entered as R expression, e.g. "0.05/7".

- When the test phase is started in the GUI, you are asked, whether
  you have (partial) knowledge about the correlations between the
  tests.

- Better support for more than one GUI window in the same R session.

- All help files open correctly on windows machines - even with 
  Java 5.0
