Version 0.7-2 (??-??-2011, Rev. ????)
=====================================

- Fixed: In 0.7-1 the options dialog throws an error.
- Fixed: In the verbose output of 0.7-1 some weights were 
  shown as p_i instead w_i. 

Version 0.7-1 (22-11-2011, Rev. 1001)
=====================================

- The GUI will (optionally) look for a newer version of 
  gMCP on CRAN.
  
- New function "subGraph" for the creation of subgraphs.

- User defined power functions.
  
Version 0.7-0 (26-Aug-2011, Rev. 964)
=====================================

- Package "graph" is no longer a dependency.
  Class definition of graphMCP has changed and is no
  longer a subclass of graphNEL. The function
  gMCP:::updateGraphToNewClassDefinition(object)
  is provided to update old serialized (saved) objects.
  The GUI will use this function on its own if necessary.

- Also not longer a dependency: gtools, xtable, MCPAN

- New dependency: lattice graphics for power simulations

- Due to S4-methods and the optional "graph" package a lot
  of renaming has taken place:
  addEdge -> setEdge, edgeData -> edgeAttr, 
  nodeData -> nodeAttr, nodes -> getNodes 

- Power simulation code from our third author
  Bjoern Bornkamp.

- New example graphs:

  - general and simple Successive Graphs
  - fixedSequence
  - Fallback Procedure
  - Truncated Holm (special case)
  - BauerEtAl2001
  - HuqueAloshEtBhore2011
  - BretzEtAl2009a/b/c

- Renaming of older example graphs to simpler names.

- CI dialog is modal.

- LaTeX-Code can be shown in Dialog and does not have 
  to be saved in a file.

- PValues can be attached to graphMCP objects as an 
  attribute "pvalues".
  
- Function graphGUI has a new parameter:
  experimentalFeatures=FALSE
  Set this to TRUE for experimental features like the following: 

- Power analysis in GUI.

- Code for adaptive procedures (marked as experimental).

Version 0.6-6 (04-Jul-2011, Rev. 860)
=====================================

- Fixed a bug in the GUI that deleted often p-values.

- Adjusted p-values are calculated also in the parametric case.

- Graphs without epsilon edges can be processed by a
  much faster procedure written in C.
  
- matrix2graph & graph2matrix deal better with variable edges.

- Hopefully setDividerLocation works now always correct, i.e. 
  the graph panel will always use 2/3 of the screen.
  
- Fractions like (1-a)/(1+b) are now shown with the 
  correct layout in the GUI.

- Speed up due to reduced Java/R communication.
  (More results are now cached in a Hashtable.)

Version 0.6-3 (09-May-2011, Rev. 767)
=====================================

- New dependency: JavaGD, MCPAN

- Example graphs have been renamed (Please look at ?exampleGraph).

- Greek small letters are allowed as variables

    (see graph2FromBretzEtAl2009 as an example).
  - epsilon has to be entered as "\epsilon" instead of "e"

- Below the graphPanel is now a new panel with 
  graph description and graph analysis. 

- Function placeNodes is now exported with new parameters:
  nrow, ncol and force
  
- We use package highlight for the manuals.

- New example graphs:
   
  - Graphs from Hung and Wang (2010) and 
    Bretz et al. (2011)

- All example graphs have a description and
  graph attributes "description" are shown in the GUI.

Version 0.6-1 (09-Apr-2011, Rev. 589)
=====================================

- We use the library JLaTeXMath for edge labeling.

- Eye candy (for example the edge labels have now a border and 
  are always drawn at the end).
  
- The settings for correlation are moved to the p-value panel.

- The value for epsilon is optionally either asked every time
  or the value from the option panel is used.

- Changed the order of the buttons in the main button panel.

- GUI is remembering the last 4 used R objects / files. 

- Since r-forge has rJava problems at the moment and does
  not provide gMCP builds, we pushed 0.6-1 early to CRAN.

Version 0.6-0 (06-Apr-2011, Rev. 547)
=====================================

- The GUI supports edges with variables (although sum checking of
  outgoing edges is disabled then till values are assigned to the
  variables.)
  
- gMCP has new arguments: approxEps=TRUE, eps=10^(-4)
  
- New function: substituteEps

- Changes in class graphMCP:
 
  - Attribute for node weights is called "nodeWeight".

Version 0.5-0 (28-Mar-2011, Rev. 525)
=====================================

- We use weights instead of direct alpha allocation in the graphs.
  This causes major API changes:

  - gMCP and many other functions have an argument alpha with an
    default 0.05

  - getAlpha is now called getWeights since it returns the weights

  - graph2weights is removed since it is a special case of getWeights

- due to these changes above, graphs that have been saved to files
  will cause errors when loaded and processed

- getX/Y were renamed into getX/YCoordinates due to Rgraphviz
  conflicts.

- graph2latex has a new argument "nodeTikZ".

- new function bdiagNA for building block diagonal matrices with NA
  values outside the diagonal

- Backward compatibility for R 2.8.0 and rJava 0.6-3.

- CTRL+C interrupts only the last R command and does not close the
  whole R session.

- CRAN has disabled checks on arch="ppc", so MacOS builds are again
  available from CRAN.

- Bug report sends now also the result from traceback()

- A lot of bug fixes for corner and edge cases

- CITATION file

- Please note that full epsilon support is postponed for version 0.6-0

Version 0.4-0 (21-Mar-2011, Rev. 462)
=====================================

  correlation structure from Florian Klinglmueller, who is now
  coauthor.

- New dependencies in this code: gtools and multcomp (and therefore
  also mvtnorm)

- gMCP has a new optional parameter "correlation".

- The new vignette "correlated.pdf" shows the new features.

- graphGUI Parameter grid is now 0 by default. This restores the last
  used grid value.

- Fractions instead of decimal numbers are shown in more places.

- Alpha values can be entered as R expression, e.g. "0.05/7".

- When the test phase is started in the GUI, you are asked, whether
  you have (partial) knowledge about the correlations between the
  tests.

- Better support for more than one GUI window in the same R session.

- All help files open correctly on windows machines - even with 
  Java 5.0
