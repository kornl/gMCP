Version 0.4-0
=============
- Accompanying doc file: Description of Edges with Infinitesimal Small Epsilon Weights
- New example graphs:

Version 0.3-4 (25-Nov-2010)
=============
- New functions: graph2matrix and matrix2graph
- Adjaceny matrix is shown and can be edited.

Version 0.3-3 (15-Nov-2010)
=============
- Be careful with epsilon edges (we never specified what exactly they are and how they should behave) 
  and please wait for version 0.4 which will handle them in a completely new way and will document it.
  Support for them is broken in this release. 
- New example graph from Hommel et al. 2007.
- Inserted missing $ in LaTeX code output from graph2latex.
- Better automatic placement of edge labels.
- Options dialog in GUI.
- All doc files are accessible from the GUI menu.
- The GUI Locale object is always set to English - that way there is no decimal separator confusion etc.
- Edges with small weights are rendered better. 
- Dialog that shows adjusted p-values with much better layout. 
- New accompanying doc file: Description of Edges with Infinitesimal Small Epsilon Weights (unfinished).
- graph2latex has the same vertical orientation as the GUI.
- Option whether we want to still show already rejected nodes or not.
- Option whether graphs should be colored or not.
- Update in the GUI for confidence intervals to avoid a confused user.
- Removed function adjPValues from public API - adjusted p-values are now calculated in the gMCP call.

Version 0.3-2 (08-Oct-2010)
=============
- Renaming of parameter in simConfint: "confintF" is now "confint"
- Updated confidence interval dialog (but still in development).
- Confidence intervals for t- and normal distribution can be calculated based on the p-values and point estimates in most cases.
- Reduced the package size.
- Further improved capabilities for bug reporting.
- We need rJava in version 0.8-3 or later.
- Vignette can be shown from inside the GUI.
- Function "setAlpha".

Version 0.3-1 (02-Oct-2010)
=============
- The GUI has a menu bar.
- Improved capabilities for bug reporting. All information that is sent is also shown.
- Workaround for a problem with the graph package when a node has no out-going edges.
- Numbers are now accepted with "." and "," as decimal points
- A newly created edge is now by default an epsilon edge.
- Edges from one node to itself (loops) are not allowed any more.
- Start button is only enabled, if the graph has any nodes.
- Bug-fix regarding epsilon edges.

Version 0.3-0 (01-Oct-2010)
=============
- Major API changes (mostly gsrmtp replaced by gMCP - but now the API should stay relatively stable).  
- GraphGUI can now also be called directly on objects of class graphMCP, like graphGUI(rejectNode(graph, "H1")).
- Small GUI bug-fix for placing edge labels while in any other zoom level than 100%.
- Completely separated nodes (which only occur in sub-optimal testing procedures) are now handled correctly.
- If the graph has no nodeRenderInfo available when the GUI is called, the edges are placed in a circle.
- Deducer support if installed and loaded.

Version 0.2-4 (30-Sep-2010)
=============
- After some alpha and beta releases on r-forge this is the first beta version on CRAN.
- We support: Graphs with epsilon edges, confidence intervals, adjusted p-values.
