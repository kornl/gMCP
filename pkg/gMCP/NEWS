Version 0.6-1 (09-Apr-2011, Rev. 589)
=====================================

- We use the library JLaTeXMath for edge labeling.

- Eye candy (for example the edge labels have now a border and 
  are always drawn at the end).
  
- The settings for correlation are moved to the p-value panel.

- The value for epsilon is optionally either asked every time
  or the value from the option panel is used.

- Changed the order of the buttons in the main button panel.

- GUI is remembering the last 4 used R objects / files. 

- Since r-forge has rJava problems at the moment and does
  not provide gMCP builds, we pushed 0.6-1 early to CRAN.

Version 0.6-0 (06-Apr-2011, Rev. 547)

Version 0.5-0 (28-Mar-2011, Rev. 525)
=====================================

- We use weights instead of direct alpha allocation in the graphs.
  This causes major API changes:

  - gMCP and many other functions have an argument alpha with an
    default 0.05

  - getAlpha is now called getWeights since it returns the weights

  - graph2weights is removed since it is a special case of getWeights

- due to these changes above, graphs that have been saved to files
  will cause errors when loaded and processed

- getX/Y were renamed into getX/YCoordinates due to Rgraphviz
  conflicts.

- graph2latex has a new argument "nodeTikZ".

- new function bdiagNA for building block diagonal matrices with NA
  values outside the diagonal

- Backward compatibility for R 2.8.0 and rJava 0.6-3.

- CTRL+C interrupts only the last R command and does not close the
  whole R session.

- CRAN has disabled checks on arch="ppc", so MacOS builds are again
  available from CRAN.

- Bug report sends now also the result from traceback()

- A lot of bug fixes for corner and edge cases

- CITATION file

- Please note that full epsilon support is postponed for version 0.6-0

Version 0.4-0 (21-Mar-2011, Rev. 462)
=====================================

- Added code for graph based MCPs with partial knowledge of the
  correlation structure from Florian Klinglmueller, who is now
  coauthor.

- New dependencies in this code: gtools and multcomp (and therefore
  also mvtnorm)

- gMCP has a new optional parameter "correlation".

- The new vignette "correlated.pdf" shows the new features.

- graphGUI Parameter grid is now 0 by default. This restores the last
  used grid value.

- Fractions instead of decimal numbers are shown in more places.

- Alpha values can be entered as R expression, e.g. "0.05/7".

- When the test phase is started in the GUI, you are asked, whether
  you have (partial) knowledge about the correlations between the
  tests.

- Better support for more than one GUI window in the same R session.

- All help files open correctly on windows machines - even with 
  Java 5.0

  in 0.3-5.

- C compiler is needed for building gMCP since the first C source file
  was added.

- When saving/loading graphs, reports or png/LaTeX files, the last
  directory is remembered.

- Adjusted p-values are now truncated and can not be bigger than one.

Version 0.3-3 (15-Nov-2010, Rev. 318)
=====================================

  are and how they should behave) and please wait for version 0.6
  which will handle them in a completely new way and will document it.
  Support for them is broken in this release.

- Inserted missing $ in LaTeX code output from graph2latex.

  Small Epsilon Weights (unfinished). [Removed in 0.3-4]
