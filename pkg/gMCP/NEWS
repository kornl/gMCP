Version 0.2.5
=============
- GraphGUI can now also be called directly on objects of class graphSRMTP, like graphGUI(rejectNode(graph, "H1"))
- Small bugfix for placing edge labels while in another zoom level than 100%.
- Completely separated nodes (which only occur in suboptimal testing procedures) are now handled correctly.
- If the graph has no nodeRenderInfo available when the GUI is called, the edges are placed in a circle.

Version 0.2.4
=============
- First commit to CRAN.
- We support: Graphs with epsilon nodes, confidence intervals, adjusted p-values.
