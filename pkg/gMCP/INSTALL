The installation of gMCP via install.packages("gMCP") should be unproblematic.

However some of the packages gMCP depends on or suggests can be tricky to install on non-windows machines.

rJava:
======

Follow the instructions of rJava.

For Windows:
If you run into a "MSVCR71.dll is is missing" please try adding your JAVA_HOME directory (something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\") to your PATH.

For Unix:
Most likely you will have to run the command "R CMD javareconf" with root permissions to let R find your java compiler and headers.

Rgraphviz:
==========

For visualization the method renderGraph from package Rgraphviz can be used, which uses the graphviz library.
Therefore you need to install the libraries and headers necessary to link graphviz library routines into the Rgraphviz package.
For example on Debian/Ubuntu you need to install the package libgraphviz-dev beforehand:

sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev

To install Rgraphviz, start R and enter:

source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Rgraphviz")
