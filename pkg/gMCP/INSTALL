PLEASE USE R 2.12 OR A NEWER VERSION OF R, IF AVAILABLE.
IF YOU NEED gMCP FOR AN OLDER VERSION OF R, PLEASE CONTACT US!
(It is theoretically compatible with R 2.8.0 and rJava 0.6-3)

gMCP requires Java >= 5.0 - most likely it is already installed on 
your computer. If it is not, download and install it from: 
http://www.java.com/en/download/

If you have not R already installed, you can download it
bundled with gMCP and all dependencies from:

 http://www.algorithm-forge.com/gMCP/R_with_gMCP.zip 
 Unzip it and double click on the R.exe in folder "bin" to
 bring up an R console with an automatically started gMCP GUI.

General Troubleshooting:
========================

 * "Warning: unable to move temporary installation 'XYZ' to 'ZYX'"
If you get this warning while installing or updating packages,
most likely some other Windows program is accessing the newly installed 
files and prevents R to move them to the correct place.
Often simply trying to install the package a second time works.
Otherwise try to pause your antivirus programs or search indexing 
(like Google Desktop Search) while installing the packages.

 * If you run into a "MSVCR71.dll is missing" please try updating your
rJava installation (install.packages("rJava")) or add your JAVA_HOME
directory (something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\") to your
PATH.

 * If "rJava.dll" can not be loaded or the "jvm.dll" can not be found
try setting JAVA_HOME in R before loading rJava or gMCP:

Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME="C:/Program Files/Java/jre6/")

(Please check that this is the correct path on your system for your 
Java 6 installation and adapt it otherwise.)

 * "Error: cannot obtain Class.getSimpleName method ID" or
   "Error in .jinit() : unable to find the basic String class"
It looks like you have an ancient Java version installed (Java 1.4 is 
from 2002!) that is used.
Please check that Java >= 1.5 is installed and try to tell rJava to use 
this newer version of Java by setting JAVA_HOME accordingly as described 
in the previous paragraph.

 * rJava does not install on a UNIX system. 
Most likely you will have to run the command "R CMD javareconf" with
root permissions to let R find your java compiler and headers.
