The installation of gMCP via install.packages("gMCP") should be unproblematic for Linux and Windows users.
However two of the packages gMCP depends on or suggests can be tricky to install on non-windows machines. 

If you use a Mac please use 
install.packages("gMCP", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
since there is an error for the Mac version of gMCP on CRAN since 3.6-0.

rJava:
======

Follow the instructions of rJava.

For Windows:
If you run into a "MSVCR71.dll is missing" please try adding your JAVA_HOME directory (something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\") to your PATH.

For Unix:
Most likely you will have to run the command "R CMD javareconf" with root permissions to let R find your java compiler and headers.

Rgraphviz:
==========

For visualization the method renderGraph from package Rgraphviz can be used, which uses the graphviz library.
Therefore you need to install the libraries and headers necessary to link graphviz library routines into the Rgraphviz package.
For example on Debian/Ubuntu you need to install the package libgraphviz-dev beforehand:

sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev

To install Rgraphviz, start R and enter:

source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Rgraphviz")

Compatibility for R 2.8.0
=========================

gMCP is still compatible with R 2.8.0.
Please install the dependencies manually:
install.packages(c("rJava", "MASS", "PolynomF", "multcomp", "graph", "gtools", "xtable"))
and build the current gMCP package from source for your system 
or use a build for a current version (apart from the help pages everything should work).
