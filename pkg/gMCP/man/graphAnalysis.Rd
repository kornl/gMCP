\usage{
graphAnalysis(graph, file = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A graph of class \code{\link{graphMCP}}.}

\item{file}{A connection, or a character string naming the file to print to.
If \code{""} (the default), the analysis is printed to the standard output
connection (the console unless redirected by \code{sink}).  If it is
\code{"|cmd"}, the output is piped to the command given by \code{cmd}, by
opening a pipe connection [taken from the manual page of \code{cat}, which
is called in this function].}
}
\value{
A character string that contains the printed analysis.
}
\description{

}
\details{
In the moment it is only tested whether each node is accessible from each
other node. Further analysis will be added in future versions.
