}
\usage{
	graphAnalysis(graph, file = "")
}

\arguments{
  \item{graph}{
	A graph of class \code{\link{graphMCP}}.
  }
  \item{file}{ 
  	A connection, or a character string naming the file to print
    to.  If \code{""} (the default), the analysis is printed to the standard
    output connection (the console unless redirected by \code{sink}).
    If it is \code{"|cmd"}, the output is piped to the command given
    by \code{cmd}, by opening a pipe connection [taken from the manual page
    of \code{cat}, which is called in this function].
  }
}

	each other node. Further analysis will be added in future versions.
}
