Planed for this release are:

- Support for sub-families of hypotheses.

- Annotation features.

- Improved logging and bug reporting (showing less but more relevant information).
  
- Improved documentation and user guidance.

- Parametric tests for the two-sided test case.


- Variable node weights

- Error reports can be saved as zip files.

- Improved graph analysis

- Improved focus keeping and reliability of description text field.





- Option for graph creation: If the "add node" button is selected each further click 
  adds nodes until another button is clicked. Similar option for edges. 
  (But do not place nodes above other nodes.)

- Experimental: Support for entangled graphs in the GUI

- Experimental: Support for adaptive studies in the GUI
    
- Experimental: Toolkit for annotating graphs (+TikZ export support of annotations)

- If the GUI is closed and the last graph was not yet saved,
  the user is asked whether he wants to save it.
