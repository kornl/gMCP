=====================================

- If the GUI is closed and the last graph was not yet saved,
  the user is asked whether he wants to save it.

- Variable node weights

- Error reports can be saved as zip files.

- Improved graph analysis

- More correlation matrices for standard designs + added unbalanced designs.

- Improved focus keeping and reliability of description text field.

  adds nodes until another button is clicked. Similar option for edges. 
  (But do not place nodes above other nodes.)

- Experimental: Support for adaptive studies in the GUI
    
- Experimental: Toolkit for annotating graphs (+TikZ export support of annotations)
